| :sup:`2` *Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN) - Section of Rome, Italy*

| The main developer of FRED code. He is a physicist specialised in modelling and numerical simulations. He is an Associate Professor at Sapienza University where he teaches General Physics in undergraduate courses, and Plasma Physics and Modern Physics in master courses. The most active fields of research are the optimisation of dose deposition in cancer therapy using accelerated charged particles; the study of gain and robustness of capsule implosions in Shock Ignition; the target design for Inertial Confinement Fusion; the generation and transport of fast electrons in dense hot plasma for advanced ignition schemes in fusion energy research; the acceleration and transport of proton beams for plasma diagnostics; the study of electron bunch instabilities in linacs and storage rings.
